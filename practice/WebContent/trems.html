<h3>RideShare offers to its Members an online booking service (hereinafter, the “Booking Service”) with a view to facilitate the booking of seats by Passengers.
<br><br>

<br><br>
The Passenger books one or more seats in the car for that Trip from the Site exclusively by clicking on the button « Book » (hereinafter, the “Booking”).
<br><br>
RideShare will then send an email confirmation to each of the Driver and the Passenger confirming the Booking (hereinafter, the “Booking Confirmation”). Once a Booking Confirmation has been sent, the Booking is complete and a separate binding agreement for Car-Sharing relating to theTrip shall be formed between the Car-Owner and Passenger.
<br><br>
Members accept that given the nature of the service Car Owners and Co-Travelers will have no recourse to RideShare for any aspect of the transaction including in relation to cancellation, last minute changes, failure by the Car Owner or the Co-Traveler to turn up or non-payment of the Cost Contribution. In particular it is the Car Owner’s responsibility to collect payment from the Co-Traveler at the time of the Trip.
<br><br>
RideShare will not contact either party and will take no other steps whatsoever than those described above to manage the booking. The operation of the Trip is solely managed by the respective Car Owner and Co-Traveler(s).
<br><br>
Please note that RideShare reserves the right to change any aspect of the Site or the Service which may include adding new services (which may require payment) or withdrawing any existing Services. RideShare does not guarantee that the Site will be functional at all times and Services may be suspended during such period when the Site is not in operation. RideShare will not be liable to any of the Members in case where the Site is non-operational.
<br><br>
<h3>2.4 Car Owner and Co-Traveler Obligations</h3>
<h3>Car Owner’s obligations
<br><br>
The Car Owner agrees:
<br><br>
That the Trip shall not be for any fraudulent, unlawful or criminal activity.
<br><br>
That they will procure for the Vehicle, a comprehensive insurance policy, which provides insurance cover to the occupants in the Vehicle and covers third party liability.
<br><br>
That they will present themselves on time and at the place agreed with the specified Vehicle;
<br><br>
That they will immediately inform all Co-Travelers of any change whatsoever to the Trip. If one or more Co-Travelers have made a booking and the Car Owner decides to change any aspect of the Trip, the Car Owner undertakes to contact all Co-Travelers who have made a booking in relation to that Trip and to obtain the agreement of all Co-Travelers to the change. If a Co-Traveler refuses the change, they are entitled to a full refund and without any compensation being paid to the Car Owner.
<br><br>
The Car Owner must comply with the Good Conduct Charter at all times.
<br><br>
The Car Owner must wait for the Co-Traveler at the pickup point for at least 30 minutes after the agreed time (however, the Co-Traveler is expected to be punctual).
<br><br>
Co-Traveler obligations
<br><br>
The Co-Traveler agrees:
<br><br>
That the Trip shall not be for any fraudulent, unlawful or criminal activity.
<br><br>
That they will present themselves on time and at the place agreed with the Car Owner;
<br><br>
That they will immediately inform the Car Owner or RideShare if they are required to cancel a Trip.
<br><br>
That they will comply with the Good Conduct Charter at all times.
<br><br>
The Co-Traveler agrees to wait at the pickup point for at least 30 minutes after the agreed time for the Car Owner to arrive.
<br><br>
That they will pay the Cost Contribution to the Car Owner.
<br><br>
If the Co-Traveler or Car Owner fail to comply with any of these terms or any other Conditions RideShare reserves the right to keep information relating to the breach, to publish or disclose this information on the Member’s online profile and to suspend or withdraw the Member’s access to the Site.
<br><br>
That they shall ensure that all other persons who accompany the Co-Traveller in the Trip comply with these Conditions as applicable to a Co-Traveller.
<br><br>
<h3>2.5 Insurance</h3>
<h3>The Car Owner agrees and undertakes to take out and maintain a comprehensive insurance to cover third party liability, the occupants of the Vehicle and the Trip offered or booked through the Site. The Car Owner agrees that they will, on request, provide the Co-Traveler with evidence, in advance of the Trip, of the complete validity of its insurance policy. The Car Owner also undertakes to hold a valid driving licence and that the Car Owner will own or will be entitled to use the Vehicle and that the Vehicle will have a valid PUC (Pollution Under Control) certificate and the Co-Traveler is entitled to request evidence of the Car Owner’s insurance, registration certificate (‘log book’), driving licence and PUC certificate at any time up to completion of the Trip.
<br><br>
It is RideShare understanding that governmental authorities take the view that a Co-Traveler who contributes only towards travel expenses is treated as travelling without hire or reward to the driver, and is therefore a third party passenger who is covered by comprehensive third party insurance policy in India. However RideShare gives no warranty or assurance in this regard and it is the Car Owner’s responsibility to verify that their insurance provides adequate cover.
<br><br>
It is up to each Car Owner and Co-Traveler to confirm with each other that the Car Owner is covered by valid insurance. The Car Owner must confirm that their insurance policy allows them to carry Co-Travelers and that their insurance policy covers all Co-Travelers and any accident or incident which may occur during a Trip.
<br><br>
The Car Owner and the Co-Traveler are aware that standard non-commercial insurance policies may refuse to cover loss or damage arising in the event that the Car Owner had made or was seeking to make a profit.
<br><br>
The Car Owner may collect no payment from the Co-Traveler other than the Cost Contribution and the Car Owner must not in any event provide Vehicle on hire or for reward in any form.
<br><br>
The Car Owner therefore undertakes to calculate their expenses (fuel, toll, maintenance, repairs, depreciation and insurance of their vehicle) and guarantees that the total Cost Contributions requested from their Co-Travelers does not result in the Vehicle running for hire or for reward.
<br><br>
If the Car Owner does receive any hiring charges or reward, or if the insurers repudiate or refuse to accept any claim arising during a Trip for any other reason, the Car Owner will be responsible for the financial consequences, losses and damages arising and RideShare will not be liable under any circumstances to the Car Owner or the Co-Traveler.
<br><br>
RideShare reserves the right, but not the obligation at its own discretion, to suspend immediately the account of a user including the money displayed and to make aware to competent authorities any professional activity.
<br><br>
<h3>2.6 Management of Disputes Between Members</h3>
<h3>RideShare may at its sole discretion provide its Members with an online service for resolving disputes. This service is non-binding. RideShare is under no obligation to seek to resolve disputes and this service is offered at RideShare sole discretion and may be withdrawn at any time.

<br><br>

The Member may do this by providing RideShare with their mobile phone number, after which the Member will receive a SMS with a 4-digit code which can be validated on the Site. This service is free of charge, except for the possible cost levied by a Member’s mobile phone operator for receiving the SMS.
